# 👋 Hey, I’m Wen Siu

Code is my hobby, so I keep tinkering with 3D scenes, software architecture, and system design long after the workday ends. This page is a playful snapshot of the sandbox I return to whenever curiosity calls.

## 🎮 What I’m Having Fun Building
- **3D problem solving for medical tooling:** prototyping immersive visualizations and light, responsive tooling layers so specialists can explore scans with precision while I nudge the team toward modular, reusable components.  
- **Software architecture leadership:** designing layered APIs and data contracts, mentoring engineers to spot anti-patterns quickly, and rallying teams around traceable, testable structure rather than one-off hacks.
- **Systems design experiments:** sketching large-scale data pipelines and edge orchestration for high-availability scenarios, then coaching collaborators on trade-offs between latency, consistency, and simplicity.

## 🎲 What I’m Playing With
- OpenGL + mesh ops for tactile 3D experiences that feel less like math and more like playing with light.  
- System design puzzles that mix MQTT, HTTP, and BACnet with clean, event-driven domain models.  
- Architecture rituals: TDD checklists, SOLID reviews, and pairing sessions that turn every sprint into a mini workshop.

## Tools & Rituals
- **Languages:** C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL  
- **Frameworks & UI:** .NET Framework, WPF, WinForms, React, QT, WxWidgets  
- **Infra & AI:** Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn  
- **Practices:** Git + GitHub, CI/CD, Agile/SAFe, Architectural patterns, System design modeling
